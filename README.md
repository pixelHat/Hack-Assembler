# Hack Assembler

An assembler for the hack computer developed for the [Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer) course.

The project should be able to compile any assembly code made for the Hack computer. The [tests](https://github.com/pixelHat/Hack-Assembler/tree/main/tests/asm) folder provides some examples.
